Refactor the entire application according to the following requirements:

Remove as many backend and server dependencies as possible.
The app should work primarily on the client side using JavaScript/TypeScript and direct API calls.

Completely remove any existing backend authentication logic, including:

NextAuth

Custom auth routes

Custom middleware

Custom API endpoints related to authentication

Any local database-based auth

Replace all authentication with Supabase Auth using Google OAuth.
Implement the following:

Client-side login with Supabase signInWithOAuth({ provider: "google" })

Session handling using Supabase built-in session storage

Logout with supabase.auth.signOut()

User state stored and reactive through Supabase Auth helpers

Use Supabase as the ONLY database for the entire app.
Remove all references to other databases or backend services.
Replace them with:

Supabase tables

Supabase storage (if needed)

Direct CRUD operations from the client

All application data (projects, menu generations, user selections, etc.) must be stored in Supabase.
No backend server should be required to read or write data.

The app should remain fully functional even without a backend server.
All logic should work via:

Supabase client

Claude API calls

Client-side React components

Make sure Stripe subscription logic is optional, controlled by a config flag.
If subscription is disabled:

No Stripe UI

No paywalls

All features free

Ensure the entire application is optimized for a pure frontend deployment, like:

Vercel static hosting

Replit deployments

Netlify

Supabase Edge Functions (optional only)

Provide fully functional code, including:

Supabase client initialization

Auth UI components

Hooks for session handling

Refactored pages

Updated logic for user data

Updated API call logic for Claude

After refactoring, ensure the project:

works end-to-end

allows login with Google

stores user data in Supabase

generates and displays AI menus

optionally blocks downloads using the subscription flag
